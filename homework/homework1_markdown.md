## The Importance of Taking Chances and Giving Back


# Some of DJ Patil's quotes

* People make a mistake by forgetting
that data science is a team sport.

* Because of the pace at which the
world changes, the only way to
prepare yourself is by having that
dynamic range.

* If you watch kids running around a track, and
the parents want to leave, the kids always
answer, “One more! One more!” You watch
an adult run laps, and they are thinking, “How
many more do I have to do?”

* Only work on simple things; simple
things become hard, hard things
become intractable.

## Creating Your Own Data Science Curriculum


# Some of CLARE CORTHELL's experience

* I started thinking about observing meta-trends among
users instead of studying their behavior with a clipboard
from behind a one-way window. What if I just ran several
tests on two different prototypes? Then we would have
data to tell us which one to develop!

* The internet was astonishingly supportive and
excited — and that excitement is addictive. It
makes you want to be more transparent, and to
become part of other peoples’ wonder in learning
new things.

* You don’t have to know everything. That’s why
I’ve tried to keep the curriculum so tightly
focused on its goal. Programmers are great at
“just-in-time” learning because it’s impossible
to know everything.

* The ability to evolve my own career
with a self-designed curriculum begins
to outline the immense cracks in the
foundation of higher education

* Talk with people wh can recongnize
hustle and grit, and not necessarily those
who are looking to match a pattern
drawn from your previous experience.

### Michelangelo's advice

I always tell students that I think the most useful skill
you learn in grad school is how to teach yourself stuff
and how to figure out things that you don't know.
That’s one thing. The second thing is to be stubborn
and beat your head on a problem until you make
progress. It’s really those two things.

I do worry that there’s a little bit of
hype, but it’s undeniable that there’s
a very solid grain of truth to the whole
data science thing.

This is why I’m excited about more
positive examples of data applications.
I think the more positive examples of
data science that we have, the more it
will help counteract a lot of the hype.
